## Key Insights
Bike purchases were notably higher among customers with higher income levels, particularly males.
Short commute distances (0â€“5 miles) correlated with increased likelihood of purchasing a bike.
Customers who were married and had graduate-level education showed slightly higher purchase rates.
Regional differences were observed, with Europe and North America leading in overall purchases compared to the Pacific region.
